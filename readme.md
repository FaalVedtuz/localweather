# LOCAL WEATHER

### What does this app do?

This app is a submission to the freeCodeCamp challenge Local Weather. This app detects the usurs location by using html5's geolocation, I did not save the users location for simpler approach and security (if it is an issue), it then get the current weather on the user's location and display it. It can also convert the current temperature to farenheit and vice versa.

#### Frameworks / Tools used

* [Materialize Framework](http://materializecss.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is really awesome!
* [Mashape Marketplace](https://market.mashape.com) for the free weather API. You can find more API's here, both free and freemium.
