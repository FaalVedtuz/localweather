# LOCAL WEATHER

### What does this app do?

This app is a submission to the freeCodeCamp challenge Local Weather. This app detects the usurs location by using html5's geolocation, I did not save the users location for simpler approach and security (if it is an issue), it then get the current weather on the user's location and display it. It can also convert the current temperature to farenheit and vice versa.
